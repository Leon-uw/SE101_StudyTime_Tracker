# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## ✅ What Went Well
- Exceeded sprint goals and overall expectations  
- Strong communication within the team  
- No merge conflicts encountered  
- Good organization and coordination  

## ⚙️ What Could Be Improved#
- Clarify **user stories** earlier in the sprint  
- Address **role confusion** (e.g., Team A had some confusion with roles as all tasks were completed ahead of schedule)  
  - Going forward, each member will take an **extra role** or self-assign additional tasks if idle  
  - Encourage initiative — “if nothing to do, find something extra”  
- Begin **merging** earlier, before sprint review/retrospective  
- Did not do **Sprint 1 Review** early enough — will speed this up in the next sprint  

## 📈 Velocity
- Ahead of schedule - completed everything required for the sprint.
