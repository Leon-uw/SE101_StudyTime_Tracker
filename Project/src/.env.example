# Database Configuration
# ======================

# USE_LOCAL_DB: Switch between MySQL (production) and SQLite (local development)
# - Set to "true" for SQLite local development (uses local_dev.db file)
# - Set to "false" or leave commented for MySQL production server
# Default: false (MySQL)
USE_LOCAL_DB=false

# MySQL Configuration (when USE_LOCAL_DB=false)
# Required: Userid and Password for remote MySQL server
# Server: riku.shoshin.uwaterloo.ca
# Database: SE101_Team_21
Userid=your_userid_here
Password=your_password_here

# SQLite Configuration (when USE_LOCAL_DB=true)
# No additional configuration needed - uses local_dev.db in the same directory
# Automatically created on first run with test data:
#   - Username: testuser
#   - Password: password

# Notes:
# - The application automatically handles schema differences between MySQL and SQLite
# - Seed data differs between databases (admin for MySQL, testuser for SQLite)
# - Both databases use the same table structure and API
